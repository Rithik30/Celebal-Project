## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project was developed during an internship and uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to analyze the credit risk of individuals based on their financial attributes. The model is trained on the [UCI German Credit Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)) and deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive use.
